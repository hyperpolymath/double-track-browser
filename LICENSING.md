# Licensing Information

## Dual License

DoubleTrack Browser is dual-licensed under:

1. **MIT License** (primary, for maximum compatibility)
2. **Palimpsest License v0.8** (alternative, for RSR compliance)

You may choose either license when using, modifying, or distributing this software.

## Why Dual License?

- **MIT**: Permissive, widely understood, maximum compatibility with other projects
- **Palimpsest v0.8**: Supports reversibility principles and RSR Framework goals

## License Texts

- MIT License: See [LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT)
- Palimpsest License v0.8: See [LICENSE-PALIMPSEST](LICENSE-PALIMPSEST)
- Historical GPL-3.0: See [LICENSE](LICENSE) (retained for historical purposes)

## How to Choose

### Use MIT if you want:
- Maximum compatibility
- Simple, well-understood terms
- No additional obligations
- Commercial use without restrictions

### Use Palimpsest v0.8 if you want:
- Support for reversibility principles
- Alignment with RSR Framework values
- Recognition of emotional safety in software development

## For Contributors

By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same dual license (MIT + Palimpsest v0.8).

## For Users

When using this software:
1. Choose which license you prefer (MIT or Palimpsest v0.8)
2. Include the appropriate LICENSE file with your distribution
3. Provide attribution as specified in your chosen license

## Clarifications

**Q: Can I mix and match terms from both licenses?**
A: No. Choose one license and follow its terms entirely.

**Q: What if I'm unsure which to use?**
A: MIT is the simpler, more widely understood option. Use MIT unless you specifically need Palimpsest v0.8.

**Q: Can I relicense under just one license?**
A: If you redistribute our code, you must offer the same dual license. Derivative works may choose stricter terms compatible with your chosen license.

**Q: What about the GPL-3.0 LICENSE file?**
A: That was the original license. As of v0.1.1, the project has transitioned to MIT + Palimpsest v0.8 dual licensing. The GPL-3.0 file is retained for historical reference but is no longer the active license.
