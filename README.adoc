= DoubleTrack Browser
:toc: macro
:toclevels: 2

The pendulum has swung way too far on the privacy front.
DoubleTrack Browser puts a hard stop to attempts to limit the reckless sharing of even your most intimate data.

== The Pendulum Swings Back

*DoubleTrack Browser* is a radical experiment in digital identity management. While most privacy tools focus on hiding your data, DoubleTrack takes the opposite approach—it deliberately creates a rich, consistent, but entirely fictional digital presence alongside your real one.

== Core Architecture

This project is built on a hybrid architecture that prioritizes both performance and memory safety:

- *Rust Core*: Powers the profile generation and activity simulation engine, compiled to WebAssembly for browser integration
- *ReScript*: Type-safe browser API integration and UI components (compiles to JavaScript)
- *Deno*: Modern runtime for build scripts and development tooling
- *WebExtensions API*: Provides the hooks needed for background operation

== Key Features

- *Parallel Identity Generation*: Creates believable, consistent alternative browsing patterns
- *Background Activity Engine*: Simulates browsing behavior even when you're not actively using your computer
- *Memory-Safe Design*: Uses Rust's ownership model to ensure your real data remains protected
- *Configurable Noise Levels*: Adjust how active your alternative identity should be

== Why DoubleTrack Exists

In a world where your data is constantly harvested, the traditional approach of trying to hide becomes increasingly futile. Data brokers have become too sophisticated, tracking technologies too pervasive.

DoubleTrack explores a different hypothesis: What if, instead of trying to be invisible, you become deliberately, strategically visible—but in ways that obscure rather than reveal?

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

- https://deno.land/[Deno] (v2.0+)
- https://rustup.rs/[Rust] toolchain
- https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/[wasm-pack]
- https://github.com/casey/just[just] task runner (optional)

=== Installation

[source,bash]
----
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/double-track-browser.git
cd double-track-browser

# Check dependencies
just install

# Build everything (Rust + ReScript + Extension)
just build

# Or without just:
deno task build
----

Then load the extension from the `dist/` directory into your browser's developer mode.

== Warning

This is experimental software. While designed with security in mind, it may have unintended consequences for your online experience. Use at your own risk and only on personal devices.

== RSR Framework Compliance

This project adheres to the *Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR) Framework* and achieves *Gold Level* compliance (91%):

* ✅ *Documentation*: README, LICENSE, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, MAINTAINERS, CHANGELOG
* ✅ *.well-known/*: RFC 9116 security.txt, ai.txt (AI training policy), humans.txt (attribution)
* ✅ *Type Safety*: Rust compile-time guarantees + ReScript type system
* ✅ *Memory Safety*: Rust ownership model, zero unsafe blocks
* ✅ *Build System*: Deno, wasm-pack, justfile, Mustfile.epx
* ✅ *CI/CD*: GitHub Actions with security audits, linting, and testing
* ✅ *Test Coverage*: Comprehensive tests (Rust + Deno)
* ✅ *Offline-First*: Zero network dependencies, works air-gapped

See link:RSR_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md[RSR_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md] for detailed audit.

== Language Policy

This project follows the *Hyperpolymath Standard* language policy:

- *ReScript* instead of TypeScript
- *Deno* instead of npm/Node.js
- *Rust* for performance-critical code
- *justfile* instead of Makefile

See link:.claude/CLAUDE.md[.claude/CLAUDE.md] for the complete policy.

== Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

This project uses the *TPCF* to manage trust and contributions:

=== Perimeter 3: Community Sandbox (Current)
- *Access*: Open to all
- *Scope*: All public contributions
- *Requirements*: Follow Code of Conduct, sign commits (optional)
- *Review*: All PRs reviewed before merge

=== Perimeter 2: Trusted Contributors (Future)
- Access granted after sustained contributions (3+ months, 10+ merged PRs)
- Code review privileges, issue triage, mentoring

=== Perimeter 1: Core Stewards (Future)
- Invitation-only for long-term maintainers
- Strategic decisions, governance, security response

*Current Status*: Only Perimeter 3 is active. See link:MAINTAINERS.md[MAINTAINERS.md] for details.

== Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This project values:

- *Reversibility*: Experiments should be safe to try and easy to undo
- *Emotional Safety*: No blame culture, mistakes are learning opportunities
- *Diverse Expertise*: All skill levels welcome
- *Sustainable Pace*: No crunch time, life comes first

See link:CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING.md] for guidelines and link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md] for community standards.
