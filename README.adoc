The pendulum has swung way too far on the privacy front. 
DoubleTrack Browser puts a hard stop to attempts to limit the reckless sharing of even your most intimate data.

== The Pendulum Swings Back

*DoubleTrack Browser* is a radical experiment in digital identity management. While most privacy tools focus on hiding your data, DoubleTrack takes the opposite approach—it deliberately creates a rich, consistent, but entirely fictional digital presence alongside your real one.

> *"The best place to hide a leaf is in a forest."*

== Core Architecture

This project is built on a hybrid architecture that prioritizes both performance and memory safety:

- *Rust Core*: Powers the profile generation and activity simulation engine, compiled to WebAssembly for browser integration
- *TypeScript Shell*: Handles browser API integration and UI components
- *WebExtensions API*: Provides the hooks needed for background operation

== Key Features

- *Parallel Identity Generation*: Creates believable, consistent alternative browsing patterns
- *Background Activity Engine*: Simulates browsing behavior even when you're not actively using your computer
- *Memory-Safe Design*: Uses Rust's ownership model to ensure your real data remains protected
- *Configurable Noise Levels*: Adjust how active your alternative identity should be

== Why DoubleTrack Exists

In a world where your data is constantly harvested, the traditional approach of trying to hide becomes increasingly futile. Data brokers have become too sophisticated, tracking technologies too pervasive.

DoubleTrack explores a different hypothesis: What if, instead of trying to be invisible, you become deliberately, strategically visible—but in ways that obscure rather than reveal?

== Getting Started

```bash
= Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/double-track-browser.git

= Install dependencies
cd double-track-browser
npm install

= Build the Rust core
cd rust_core
wasm-pack build

= Build the extension
cd ..
npm run build
```

Then load the extension from the `dist/` directory into your browser of choice.

== Warning

This is experimental software. While designed with security in mind, it may have unintended consequences for your online experience. Use at your own risk and only on personal devices.

== RSR Framework Compliance

== Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

This project uses the *TPCF* to manage trust and contributions:

=== *Perimeter 3: Community Sandbox* (Current)
- *Access*: Open to all
- *Scope*: All public contributions
- *Requirements*: Follow Code of Conduct, sign commits (optional)
- *Review*: All PRs reviewed before merge

=== Perimeter 2: Trusted Contributors (Future)
- Access granted after sustained contributions (3+ months, 10+ merged PRs)
- Code review privileges, issue triage, mentoring

=== Perimeter 1: Core Stewards (Future)
- Invitation-only for long-term maintainers
- Strategic decisions, governance, security response

*Current Status*: Only Perimeter 3 is active. See [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) for details.
